Activate this plugin to disable Lazy Loading the new WP feature that was added in WP v5.5.


== Description ==

> Lazy Load disable feature just activating this plugin.

Since WordPress 5.5, Lazy Load functionality was added to WP core. 
Some plugins already implement lazy loading. So will be conflicting or redundant functionality. 
That’s not good. 

Just activate this plugin to Lazy Load Disable functionality. 
To prevent lazy loading, all you need to do is ensure that the plugin remains active.
Very simple: No settings to worry about.



== Dual approach to effectively disable lazy loading: ==

1. **Global Disabling:** It deactivates the lazy loading feature across the entire site, ensuring no images are loaded lazily.
2. **Immediate Loading:** It sets all images to load immediately by applying the `loading="eager"` attribute, further confirming that lazy loading is disabled.

This combined strategy ensures that lazy loading is fully disabled and images load as soon as they are needed.


**How to Verify Plugin Functionality:**

To ensure the plugin is working as intended, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Page Source:**
   - **Open your web page in a browser.**
   - **Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" or press `Ctrl+U` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+U` (Mac).**
   - **Look for image tags (`<img>`) in the HTML source.**
   - **Verify that the `loading` attribute is set to `eager` for images.** This indicates that the images are configured to load immediately, not lazily. For example, you should see `<img ... loading="eager">` in the source code.

2. **No `loading="lazy"` Attribute:**
   - **Ensure that no images have the `loading="lazy"` attribute.** The absence of this attribute confirms that lazy loading has been disabled.

**Privacy**

This plugin does not collect or store any user data. It does not set any cookies, and it does not connect to any third-party locations. Thus, this plugin does not affect user privacy in any way.
